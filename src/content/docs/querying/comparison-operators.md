## Comparison Operators

UQL provide a comprehensive set of operators for comparing field values. These operators are context-aware, meaning they are typed according to the field they are applied to.

| Name           | Description                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$eq`          | Equal to.                                                                          |
| `$ne`          | Not equal to.                                                                      |
| `$lt`          | Less than.                                                                         |
| `$lte`         | Less than or equal to.                                                             |
| `$gt`          | Greater than.                                                                      |
| `$gte`         | Greater than or equal to.                                                          |
| `$startsWith`  | Starts with (case-sensitive).                                                      |
| `$istartsWith` | Starts with (case-insensitive).                                                    |
| `$endsWith`    | Ends with (case-sensitive).                                                        |
| `$iendsWith`   | Ends with (case-insensitive).                                                      |
| `$includes`    | Contains substring (case-sensitive).                                               |
| `$iincludes`   | Contains substring (case-insensitive).                                             |
| `$in`          | Value matches any in a given array.                                                |
| `$nin`         | Value does not match any in a given array.                                         |
| `$text`        | Full-text search (where supported by the database).                                |

### Practical Example

```ts
import { pool } from './shared/orm.js';
import { User } from './shared/models/index.js';

const users = await pool.transaction(async (querier) => {
  return querier.findMany(User, {
    $select: { id: true, name: true },
    $where: { 
      name: { $istartsWith: 'Some', $ne: 'Something' },
      age: { $gte: 18, $lte: 65 }
    },
    $sort: { name: 1 },
    $limit: 50
  });
});
```

### Context-Aware SQL Generation

UQL transparently handles the differences between database vendors. For example, `$istartsWith` is translated to `ILIKE` in PostgreSQL, but to `LOWER(field) LIKE 'some%'` in MySQL.

**SQL for PostgreSQL:**
```sql
SELECT "id", "name" FROM "User"
WHERE "name" ILIKE 'Some%' AND "name" <> 'Something' AND "age" >= 18 AND "age" <= 65
ORDER BY "name" ASC
LIMIT 50
```

**SQL for MySQL/SQLite:**
```sql
SELECT `id`, `name` FROM `User`
WHERE LOWER(`name`) LIKE 'some%' AND `name` <> 'Something' AND `age` >= 18 AND `age` <= 65
ORDER BY `name` ASC
LIMIT 50
```
