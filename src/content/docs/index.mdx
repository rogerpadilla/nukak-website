:::note[Tip]
UQL is designed to be **unobtrusive**. You don't need to change your architecture to fit the ORM; UQL fits into yours.

## Why UQL?

| Feature | **UQL** | Traditional ORMs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API** | **Unified & Intuitive**: Same syntax for SQL & NoSQL. | Fragmented: SQL and Mongo feel like different worlds. |
| **Safety** | **Deep Type-Safety**: Validates relations & operators at any depth. | Surface-level: Often loses types in complex joins. |
| **Syntax** | **Serializable JSON**: Pure data, perfect for APIs/Websockets. | Method-Chaining: Hard to transport over the wire. |
| **Efficiency** | **Sticky Connections**: Minimal overhead, human-readable SQL. | Heavy: Often generates "SQL Soup" that's hard to debug. |

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Entity-First Migrations" icon="rocket">
		Define your schema in TypeScript and let UQL generate migrations automatically. Safe by default — only adds, never drops.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Semantic Type System" icon="document">
		Use abstract types like `'uuid'`, `'json'`, `'vector'` that map correctly across all databases without dialect-specific code.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Thread-Safe Transactions" icon="random">
		Centralized serialization engine guarantees race-condition-free operations across all drivers.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Professional Logging" icon="list-format">
		Built-in slow-query detection, colored output, and customizable log levels for production monitoring.
	</Card>
