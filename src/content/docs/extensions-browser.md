## Browser Extension

The `@uql/core/browser` extension allows you to consume UQL REST APIs (generated by the [Express Extension](/extensions-express)) on the frontend with the same type-safe syntax you use on the backend.
:::note
This extension is completely optional. UQL works perfectly fine as a standalone ORM without it.
:::

### Quick Start

1.  **Initialize the HttpQuerier**:
    
    ```ts
    import { HttpQuerier } from '@uql/core/browser';

    // Configure the frontend to point to your backend API
    const querier = new HttpQuerier('https://api.yourdomain.com/api');
    ```

2.  **Query Data**: Interact with your entities as if you were on the backend.

    ```ts
    import { User } from './shared/models/index.js';

    // Deeply type-safe queries in the browser!
    const users = await querier.findMany(User, {
      $select: { 
        email: true, 
        profile: { $select: ['picture'] } 
      },
      $where: { email: { $endsWith: '@domain.com' } },
      $sort: { createdAt: 'desc' },
      $limit: 10
    });
    ```

### Shared Entities & Type Safety

One of the biggest advantages of the Browser Extension is the ability to easily share your entity classes between your backend and frontend.

```ts
// shared/models/User.ts
import { Entity, Id, Field } from '@uql/core';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @Id()
  id: string;

  @Field()
  name: string;
}

// frontend/app.ts
import { User } from '../shared/models/User.js';
const users = await querier.findMany(User, { 
  $where: { name: { $startsWith: 'A' } } 
});
// 'users' is automatically typed as User[]
```

### Authentication & Headers

You can pass standard `fetch` options (like `headers`) to any querier method. This is typically used for passing JWT tokens or other authentication credentials.

```ts
const users = await querier.findMany(User, {
  $where: { status: 'active' }
}, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.token}`,
    'X-Custom-Header': 'value'
  }
});
```

:::tip
For a truly seamless experience, wrap the `HttpQuerier` in a service that automatically injects the current user's token into every request.
:::


:::tip
Combine this with the [Express Extension](/extensions-express) to create a full-stack, type-safe data layer in minutes.
